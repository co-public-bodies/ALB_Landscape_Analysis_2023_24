Within this total, around 228,030 FTE were employed within the UK government’s ministerial departments, around 32,620 FTE within devolved governments, and a further 6,365 FTE employed within other UK Civil Service organisations.\nStaff employed within Executive Agencies and Non-Ministerial Departments are typically captured within both ACSES and the ALB Landscape publications. Organisations with these classifications collectively accounted for 241,972 FTE within the ALB Landscape. However, there are a few differences in the scope of these publications, as ACSES does not capture staff employed within the Forestry Commission (Non-Ministerial Department) and their Executive Agency, Forest Research. These organisations are ALBs sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and have classifications which mean their staff are civil servants, collectively employing 1,355 FTE. However, Forestry Commission are legislatively distinct from the UK domestic Civil Service, and therefore these ALBs do not appear within the ACSES publication.\nThe main distinction between the workforces captured by ACSES and the ALB Landscape Analysis is the NDPB workforce, who typically employ public servants, and are out of scope for ACSES. Across 194 NDPBs there were 155,235 FTE staff employed in 2023/24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons with ACSES\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect comparisons with the Annual Civil Service Employment Survey (ACSES) should be interpreted with caution, as the ACSES publication reports all staff for each organisation rounded to the nearest 5.

The reviews also analyse the boards interactions with primary stakeholders as it is important to ensure feedback on the board is received from external sources.\nThe chair is responsible for the initiation of these reviews. Internal reviews must be completed annually by each ALB. Similarly, reviews by independent bodies must also be completed but these occur every three years.\nInternal Reviews are conducted by the ALB being reviewed, the chair has oversight of the processes and must see the review to completion. They should aim to gather feedback from key stakeholders and employees. Sponsoring departments will also receive a document proposing the areas of activity to be included in the review. The scope of these reviews often varies due to vast differences in function between ALBs.\nIndependent reviews help the board self-reflect by eliminating the function board members in the review. By using external bodies to complete these reviews, it helps increase objectivity and provide key areas of focus for ALB improvement.\nOutcomes of both internal and Independent reviews must be shared with the parent department for full transparency."

Specifically, for each additional % increase of FTE in post, we can expect an increase in RDEL spending by approximately 0.97% (Estimate: 0.97%, p-value: &lt;0.0001). The model explains approximately 68.33% of the variance in RDEL spending, indicating that other factors may have some influence on spending patterns that are not captured by this model. The Adjusted R-squared value is 68.29%, suggesting a Strong fit for the data.\nSpecifically, for every time the staffing level increases tenfold (meaning if you multiply the staff by 10), the running costs go up by nearly 97%. To put it in practical terms: if you normally spend £1 million on running costs with a certain number of staff, increasing that staff number significantly (by a factor of ten) would lead to your running costs rising to about £970,000. This means that if an ALB grows tenfold, their running costs would not just go up by a small amount, but nearly double, reflecting an increase of around £970,000. This relationship highlights that having more staff typically results in much higher costs, reinforcing the idea that staffing levels have a substantial impact on overall expenses.\n\n\nModel Quality\nThe model using log-transformed values for FTE and RDEL also reveals a significant relationship between these values. However, evaluation of the model diagnostics reveals a much more healthier model. The distributions of both RDEL and FTE are normally distributed, suggesting most of the data points are centred around the midpoint of their value ranges. Examination of the residuals also suggests that the residuals follow a much more linear distribution, with evidence of homoscedasticity too (the data follows a continuous line with limited spread). While there are still outliers within the residuals, they don’t appear to violate Cook’s Distance, suggesting these residuals are not influencing the regression values, and therefore do not need to be removed.\n\n\nModel Prediction Outputs\nPredicted RDEL for an ALB with: 100 FTE is approximately £8,128,305\nPredicted RDEL for an ALB with: 1,000 FTE is approximately £75,857,758\nPredicted RDEL for an ALB with: 10,000 FTE is approximately £707,945,784\nPredicted RDEL for an ALB with: 100,000 FTE is approximately £6,606,934,480"

The residual plots also suggest that there are significant outliers that the model struggles to handle, which may be offseting the estimates of the model.\nAs such, the recommended course of action would be to use a transformation on the data when we model these values."

    "text": "ALB spending categories\nThe total amount of money that an ALB spends is called Total Managed Expenditure (TME). This can be classified as either Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) or within their Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL). AME is demand-led expenditure that is typically hard to budget for in advance, such as pension or welfare claims. Conversely, DEL is typically the body’s main budget, and is used for more predictable spending, such as long-running programmes and projects.1\nDEL spend can be further broken down into Resource DEL (RDEL) and Capital DEL (CDEL). RDEL is the cost of running the organisation, which can be on the body’s programmes or the administrative cost for supporting the body. CDEL is expenditure that provides an investment for the body, such as buying property.\nThe RDEL and CDEL figures in this section are the sums that the body actually spent (known as actual spending outturn), rather than the body’s budget for it, As such, the spending for ALBs reported below may not directly match up with the values reported in ALB Funding, which captures delegated budgets for 2023/24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash-based and non-cash-based spending\n\n\n\nWhen we commissioned departments for data on their ALBs, we asked for data on RDEL, CDEL, and AME spending to only reflect cash-based spending during 2023/24. Cash-based spending covers money spent by an ALB to cover their operations.\nNon-cash spending includes accounting adjustments, such as movements in provisions, depreciation, and adjustments for liabilities, which are often represented as negative values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALBs with no spending data\n\n\n\nCertain ALBs, such as the Met Office, have Trading Fund status, which means they do not report their spending as captured under AME, CDEL, or RDEL categories. Likewise, ALBs with particular classifications, such as Advisory NDPBs, often operate without a delegated budget from their sponsor, meaning their spending comes out of their sponsor department’s budget. For each of these types of bodies, their spending is typically reported as £0 for each category."

For additional context, the total expenditure for the UK government in 2022/23 was £1,133.6 billion, meaning ALBs represent around a third of all public expenditure.\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther types of ALB Spending\n\n\n\nFurther analysis of ALBs spending on Grants, Consultants and Contingent Labour can be found on the Other Spending page."

Most of this was attributed to HMRC, who spent £33.21 Bn billion as AME, which was 84.8% of all ALBs’ AME spend.\nHMRC uses AME spending to cover payments for Child Benefits, tax credits and other benefits, reliefs and allowances, which are all susceptible to inflationary pressures. Using AME spending allows HMRC to account for volatile changes in inflation, which may reduce the value of these payments if they were spent under DEL, which is typically allocated years in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-cash AME spending\n\n\n\nWhile our commission to Departments and ALBs asked for only cash-based AME spending, which only reflects money spent during the year, some ALBs have still reported non-cash negative values for their AME spending, which is often attributable to movements in provisions. Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount that need to be accounted for in ALBs’ financial statements. For example NDA’s Nuclear Provision (Annual Report and Accounts, p140) highlights the role that provisions under AME play in estimating the costs and liabilities associated with the retrieval and disposal of nuclear waste.\n\n\n\nPlot: Top 5Plot: Proportion AME SpendingData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly includes ALBs with finance values that did not contain adjustments/provisions in their data.

    "text": "Contingent labour and consultancy spending by ALB workforce size\nTo better understand how ALBs make use of contingent labour and consultants we carried out further statistical analyses, using linear regression models. We predicted that contingent labour costs would increase consistently relative to the size of the ALB, as measured by their workforce size. Our assumption was that larger ALBs with bigger workforces will have greater need for contingent labour, given they will likely use contingent labour to fill gaps in their workforce. We also predicted that consultancy spend would also be predicted by the size of an ALB, with larger ALBs being more likely to take on larger projects, which may require more support from consultants.\nWe found that ALBs’ spending on both contingent labour and consultants can be predicted by the size of an ALBs workforce: Larger ALBs are more likely to spend more money on both consultants and contingent labour. Interestingly, the relationship between spending and workforce size was stronger when analysing contingent labour spend, and weaker when analysing consultancy spend. This suggests that it is more difficult to predict consultancy spend depending on the size of an ALB’s workforce. Further analysis may help to identify further other predictors of these types of spending by ALBs. Details of these regression models can be found below.\n\n\nPlotLM: Contingent LabourLM: Consultancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly includes ALBs with an FTE greater than 0, and Contingent Labour or Consultancy Spend greater than £0.Cabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\n\n\nestimate\n\n\nstd.error\n\n\nstatistic\n\n\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept (Baseline)\n\n\n3632800.520\n\n\n1589759.6335\n\n\n2.285126\n\n\n0.0236794\n\n\n\n\nEach Staff In Post (FTE)\n\n\n2179.448\n\n\n189.0038\n\n\n11.531240\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\n\n\nestimate\n\n\nstd.error\n\n\nstatistic\n\n\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept (Baseline)\n\n\n1739359.9583\n\n\n854713.7140\n\n\n2.035020\n\n\n0.0435751\n\n\n\n\nEach Staff In Post (FTE)\n\n\n456.2809\n\n\n101.6155\n\n\n4.490271\n\n\n0.0000139\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of statistical analysis for contingent labour spending\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the linear regression analysis indicate a significant positive relationship between full-time equivalent (FTE) staffing and Contingent Labour spending. Specifically, for each additional FTE in post, as a measure of ALB size, we can expect an increase in Contingent Labour spending by approximately £2,179 (Estimate: £2,179, p-value: &lt;0.0001). The intercept of the model is £3,632,801 suggesting that within this model when an ALB has no workforce, the Contingent Labour spending is estimated to be: £3,632,801. This indicates that there are likely other drivers for Contingent Labour spending that are not associated with workforce size.\nThe model explains approximately 46.5% of the variance in Contingent Labour spending, as denoted by the Multiple R-squared value. The Adjusted R-squared value is 46.15%, which provides a more accurate measure of goodness-of-fit for the model that accounts for the number of predictors involved. These values suggest that while the model captures a substantial amount of the variation in Contingent Labour spending, as explained by ALB workforce size, there are other significant factors not included in this model that may also influence spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of statistical analysis for consultancy spending\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the linear regression analysis also indicate a significant positive relationship between full-time equivalent (FTE) staffing and Consultants spending. Specifically, for each additional FTE in post, as a measure of ALB size, we can expect an increase in Consultants spending by approximately £456 (Estimate: £456, p-value: &lt;0.0001). The intercept of the model is £1,739,360 suggesting that within this model when an ALB has no workforce, the Consultants spending is estimated to be: £1,739,360. This indicates that there are likely other significant drivers for Consultants spending that are not associated with workforce size.\nThe model only explains around 11.64% of the variance in Consultants spending, as denoted by the Multiple R-squared value. The Adjusted R-squared value is 11.07%. These values imply that while the model identifies a relationship between ALB workforce size and Consultants spending, it may fail to account for other more significant variables that could affect Consultants spending."

    "text": "You say there are 306 ALBs that are currently active, but the dataset only shows 253 rows, why is this?\n\nWhile there are 253 rows in the data, certain bodies are represented in the dataset as a single row, to avoid double counting of their resources. There is a column on each summary table called ‘Number Of ALBs’ and a column in the machine-readable dataset called ‘overall_body_numbers’ which provides details on these ALBs. If you add these values together, they will total to the 306 ALBs that are currently active. The most prominent example of this are the Advisory Committees On Justices Of The Peace, which are 44 Advisory NDPBs represented as a single line in the data.\n\nWhy is there missing data for certain ALBs?\n\nThe data provided below was returned to the Cabinet Office at the discretion of ALBs and their sponsoring departments. While every effort was made to ensure the data was complete as possible, not all ALBs could answer each question. Questions about specific missing datapoints should be directed to the ALB or the ALB’s sponsoring department.\n\nWhy do some ALBs not report RDEL spending split into Administrative and Programme spending?\n\nWhile RDEL Admin and Programme spending is readily available for most ALBs, it could not be provided for certain ALBs. There are a number of reasons for this:\nSome ALBs have trading fund status, wherein their spending is not recorded within RDEL, CDEL and AME categories. As such, these ALBs will typically report £0 for these types of spending.\nOther ALBs operate on a cost-recovery model, wherein they carry out work on behalf of their sponsor department and charge them to recoup the costs of the work, meaning they do not have a delegated budget in the same way other ALBs do.\nSmall ALBs, such as Advisory and Tribunal NDPBs may only convene periodically, and therefore do not typically have a delegated budget from their sponsor department. Instead, any spending by these ALBs is often taken from their sponsor department’s budget, and often only covers items such as travel expenses for their chair or board.\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this report was collected by Cabinet Office commissioning departments to return data for the ALBs that they sponsor. As such the data reflects what was reported to Cabinet Office by the departments.\nThis is a live dataset which can be subject to updates if departments wish to change their figures. Any changes made to the data will be highlight in the Changes To This Document section at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\nYou can explore the data used for this analysis by visiting our ALB Data Explorer tool, which provides more granular insights into each ALB. This tool will let you build your own charts and tables with our data, so you can make comparisons between different ALBs.\n\nThe entire dataset for this analysis covering 2023/24 can also be downloaded by using the button below.\n\n\n\n Download 2023/24 ALBs Data\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasets covering previous financial years from 2022/23, and 2019/20 back to 2012/13 can also be found here: Public Bodies Publications. The Public Bodies Directory is a publication which has evolved over a number of years, and there have been numerous changes in the scope and definitions of variables collected for these historic publications. As such, care should be taken when making comparisons with data covering previous financial years.\n\n\n\n\n\nALBs are classified, among other factors, on their level of independence from their sponsoring department, as outlined in the ALB sponsorship code of good practice. Executive agencies are typically more closely aligned with their department who often define the policies that they must follow, however the EA can decide the operational details of how to implement those policies. Departments can’t set the policies of NDPBs and NMDs but can set the strategic framework which outlines their overarching goals. Non-ministerial departments are usually considered the most independent as they typically have their own direct relationship with HM Treasury for negotiating their budgets.\nNDPBs are further classified based on their function. Advisory NDPBs perform only advisory functions whereas Executive NDPBs typically deliver frontline services to the wider public. These subclassifications can inform the way that NDPBs operate. For example, Advisory NDPBs typically operate without a dedicated workforce, and their activities are typically funded directly from within their sponsoring department’s budget. In contrast Executive NDPBs typically have their own dedicated workforce, and have budgets allocated to them by their sponsoring department and HM Treasury.\nThe Public Bodies Handbook provides a much more detailed breakdown of classifications of public bodies and ALBs sponsored by the UK government.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of ALB classifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nSource: HM Treasury managing public moneyCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\nThis website was built in"

Some Non-Ministerial Departments, such as HM Revenue and Customs, Food Standards Agency and the Forestry Commission, also sponsor other ALBs, and have direct sponsorship oversight for their ALBs.\nThe three departments who sponsored the most Arms Length Bodies were:\n\nMinistry of Justice (66)\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport (35)\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinistry of Justice’s ALB portfolio\n\n\n\nWhilst Ministry of Justice sponsors the the largest number of ALBs, it is important to note that the majority (44) of these ALBs are Advisory Committees on Justices of the Peace, which have no dedicated budget, spending or staff. These ALBs operate in an advisory capacity and any resources they do use are typically consolidated within the wider Ministry of Justice budget.\n\n\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24"

    "text": "Summaries for each ALB by sponsoring department\n\nFunding\nThe way that ALBs receive money can vary depending on their purpose and operational remit. Some ALBs are funded only by direct government funding, some ALBs are funded by levies and fees that are raised from their service users, and other ALBs are funded by a mix of government funding and levies. Below is a breakdown of the funding for each ALB sponsored by each ministerial and non-ministerial department during 2023/24.\n\n\nStaffing\nBreakdowns are also provided for the workforce composition of each ALB, showing the proportion of staff within each ALB represented by core/permanent staff (FTE) and temporary contingent labour (FTE) on the 31st March 2024.\n\n\nSpending\nSpending for most ALBs can be broken down into RDEL (Running Costs), CDEL (Investment Costs), and AME (Volatile, inflation-sensitive costs). Breakdowns below show cash-based spending for each ALB within each of these categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpending breakdowns reflect cash-based spending\n\n\n\nWhen we commissioned departments for data on their ALBs, we asked for data on RDEL, CDEL, and AME spending to only reflect cash-based spending during 2023/24.\nNon-cash spending includes movements in provisions, depreciation, and adjustments for liabilities, which are often represented as negative values.\nWhere we have received non-cash spending for these values, we have represented this as 0 below, to allow for better comparability of ALBs day-to-day spending.\nCertain ALBs, such as the Met Office, have Trading Fund status, which means they do not report their spending as captured under AME, CDEL, or RDEL categories. Likewise, ALBs with particular classifications, such as Advisory NDPBs, often operate without a delegated budget from their sponsor, meaning their spending comes out of their sponsor department’s budget. For each of these types of bodies, their spending is reported as £0 for each category.\n\n\n\n\nALBs sponsored by Attorney Generals Office in 2023/24:\n\nPlot: FundingPlot: StaffingPlot: SpendingData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcludes data where adjustments related to provisions or depreciation was provided.

This can be classified as either Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) or within their Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL). AME is demand-led expenditure that is typically hard to budget for in advance, such as pension or welfare claims. Conversely, DEL is typically the body’s main budget, and is used for more predictable spending, such as long-running programmes and projects.1\nDEL spend can be further broken down into Resource DEL (RDEL) and Capital DEL (CDEL). RDEL is the cost of running the organisation, which can be on the body’s programmes or the administrative cost for supporting the body. CDEL is expenditure that provides an investment for the body, such as buying property.\nThe RDEL and CDEL figures in this section are the sums that the body actually spent (known as actual spending outturn), rather than the body’s budget for it, As such, the spending for ALBs reported below may not directly match up with the values reported in ALB Budgets, which captures delegated budgets for 2023/24."

Using AME spending allows HMRC to account for volatile changes in inflation, which may reduce the value of these payments if they were spent under DEL, which is typically allocated years in advance.\nSome ALBs reported a negative value for their AME spending, which is often attributable to movements in provisions. Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount that need to be accounted for in ALBs’ financial statements.

    "text": "Contingent labour and consultancy spending by ALB workforce size\nTo better understand how ALBs make use of contingent labour and consultants we carried out further statistical analyses, using linear regression models. We predicted that contingent labour costs would increase consistently relative to the size of the ALB, as measured by their workforce size. Our assumption was that larger ALBs with bigger workforces will have greater need for contingent labour, given they will likely use contingent labour to plug gaps in their workforce. We also predicted that consultancy spend would also be predicted by the size of an ALB, with larger ALBs likely taking on larger projects, which may require more support from consultants.\nWe found that ALBs’ spending on both contingent labour and consultants can be predicted by the size of an ALBs workforce: Larger ALBs are more likely to spend more money on both consultants and contingent labour. Interestingly, the relationship between spending and workforce size was stronger when analysing contingent labour spend, and weaker when analysing consultancy spend. This suggests that it is more difficult to predict consultancy spend depending on the size of an ALBs. Further analysis may help to identify further other predictors of these types of spending by ALBs.

The intercept of the model is £4,562,980 suggesting that within this model when an ALB has no workforce, the Contingent Labour spending is estimated to be: £4,562,980. This indicates that there are likely other drivers for Contingent Labour spending that are not associated with workforce size.\nThe model explains approximately 40.35% of the variance in Contingent Labour spending, as denoted by the Multiple R-squared value. The Adjusted R-squared value is 39.95%, which provides a more accurate measure of goodness-of-fit for the model that accounts for the number of predictors involved. These values suggest that while the model captures a substantial amount of the variation in Contingent Labour spending, as explained by ALB workforce size, there are other significant factors not included in this model that may also influence spending.\n\n\nConsultancy spending\nThe results of the linear regression analysis also indicate a significant positive relationship between full-time equivalent (FTE) staffing and Consultants spending. Specifically, for each additional FTE in post, as a measure of ALB size, we can expect an increase in Consultants spending by approximately £455 (Estimate: £455, p-value: &lt;0.0001). The intercept of the model is £1,784,238 suggesting that within this model when an ALB has no workforce, the Consultants spending is estimated to be: £1,784,238. This indicates that there are likely other significant drivers for Consultants spending that are not associated with workforce size.\nThe model only explains around 11.56% of the variance in Consultants spending, as denoted by the Multiple R-squared value. The Adjusted R-squared value is 10.96%. These values imply that while the model identifies a relationship between ALB workforce size and Consultants spending, it may fail to account for other more significant variables that could affect Consultants spending."

Some ALBs, such as Non-Ministerial Departments operate with greater degree of independence from their sponsoring ministerial department, and may have their own relationship with HM Treasury when negotiating their budgets. Some Non-Ministerial Departments, such as HM Revenue and Customs, Food Standards Agency and the Forestry Commission, also sponsor other ALBs, and have direct sponsorship oversight for their ALBs.\nThe three departments who sponsored the most Arms Length Bodies were:\n\nMinistry of Justice (66)\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport (35)\nDepartment of Health and Social Care (23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinistry of Justice’s ALB portfolio\n\n\n\nWhilst Ministry of Justice sponsors the the largest number of ALBs, it is important to note that the majority (44) of these ALBs are Advisory Committees on Justices of the Peace, which have no dedicated budget, spending or staff.

    "text": "Summaries for each ALB by sponsoring department\n\nFunding\nThe way that ALBs receive money can vary depending on their purpose and operational remit. Some ALBs are funded only by direct government funding, some ALBs are funded by levies and fees that are raised from their service users, and other ALBs are funded by a mix of government funding and levies. Below is a breakdown of the funding for each ALB sponsored by each ministerial and non-ministerial department during 2023/24.\n\n\nStaffing\nBreakdowns are also provided for the workforce composition of each ALB, showing the proportion of staff within each ALB represented by core/permanent staff (FTE) and temporary contingent labour (FTE) on the 31st March 2024.\n\n\nSpending\nSpending for most ALBs can be broken down into RDEL (Running Costs), CDEL (Investment Costs), and AME (Volatile, inflation-sensitive costs). Breakdowns below show cash-based spending for each ALB within each of these categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpending breakdowns reflect cash-based spending\n\n\n\nWhen we commissioned departments for data on their ALBs, we asked for data on RDEL, CDEL, and AME spending to only reflect cash-based spending during 2023/24.\nNon-cash spending includes movements in provisions, depreciation, and adjustments for liabilities, which are represented as negative values.\nWhere we have received non-cash spending for these values, we have represented this as 0 below, to allow for better comparability of ALBs day-to-day spending.\nCertain ALBs, such as the Met Office, have Trading Fund status, which means they do not report their spending as captured under AME, CDEL, or RDEL categories. Likewise, ALBs with particular classifications, such as Advisory NDPBs, often operate without a delegated budget from their sponsor, meaning their spending comes out of their sponsor department’s budget. For each of these types of bodies, their spending is reported as £0 for each category.\n\n\n\n\nAttorney Generals Office\nKey figures for all ALBs sponsored by Attorney Generals Office:\n\nALBs

The CMA helps people, businesses and the UK economy by promoting competitive markets and tackling unfair behaviour in a number of ways: - we investigate mergers that have the potential to lead to a substantial lessening of competition. If a merger is likely to reduce competition substantially, the CMA can block it or impose remedies to address those concerns - we take action against businesses and individuals that take part in cartels or anti-competitive behaviour - we protect people from unfair trading practices, including in cases where unfair treatment suggests there may be a systemic market problem - we investigate entire markets if we think there are competition or consumer problems - we encourage government and other regulators to use competition effectively on behalf of consumers - we carry out regulatory appeals in relation to issues like price controls - we provide information and advice to people and businesses about rights and obligations under competition and consumer law - we provide technical advice, reporting and monitoring in relation to the UK internal market, through the Office for the Internal Market - we provide advice, reporting and monitoring in relation to government subsidies, through the Subsidy Advice Unit"

    "text": "Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE)\nInstitute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education is a Crown NDPB sponsored by Department for Education. The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) works with employer groups called trailblazers to oversee the development, approval and publication of occupational standards (which underpin apprenticeships and technical qualifications) and assessment plans and makes recommendations on funding bands to the Department for Education for each standard. It also oversees the occupational maps for T Levels, other technical qualifications (TQs) and apprenticeships. IfATE is responsible for procuring and contract managing Awarding Organisations to develop the TQs which constitute the main classroom-based element of T Levels. T Levels are two-year technical study programmes, one of three major options for students to study at level 3 alongside apprenticeships and A levels. It has also implemented a national approvals process for Higher Technical Qualifications and post 16 qualifications. IfATE ensures that all apprenticeship assessments are quality assured. IfATE has a set of important functions and accountabilities within the wider skills system. This includes a statutory oversight duty which requires IfATE to keep under review education and training within its remit, and the effect of its functions on the range and availability of that education and training. In exercising this duty, IfATE is required to consider the overall coherence of technical education provision within the system to ensure that the range and availability of apprenticeships, technical qualifications and other technical education is appropriate"

The British Council is the UK’s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities. It supports peace and prosperity by building connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide. The British Council does this through its work in arts and culture, education and the English language.\nThe British Council also has a unique mixed classification and funding model: as well as being a Charity incorporated by Royal Charter, it is classified as a Public Corporation (as designated by the ONS due to the proportion of income commercially generated) and an executive NDPB of the FCDO (as designated by the Cabinet Office). This model means that British Council funding is approximately 14% from UK Government grant-in-aid and 86% is from contracts and commercial income generated itself.\nAs part of the British Council transformation, it is in the process of delivering a major overhaul of its corporate functions including elements of outsourcing, internal restructuring and other cost savings. This includes outsourcing significant amounts of transactional work across the organisation to its new Shared Services partner Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The transformation will reduce spend on our corporate functions (Finance, HR, Procurement and Digital and Technology). This has an impact on some of the responses provided below for the year 2023-24, including higher spending on consultants than in a typical year.]{style=“margin:0px;”}"

The Law Commission’s aims are to ensure that the law is as fair, modern, simple and as cost-effective as possible. It reviews areas of the law that have become unduly complicated, outdated or unfair. It conducts research and consultation in order to: (1) make systematic recommendations for consideration by Parliament; (2) codify the law; (3) eliminate anomalies; (4) repeal obsolete and unnecessary enactments; and (5) reduce the number of separate statutes. The functions of the Law Commission are set out in two Acts, Law Commissions Act 1965 and Law Commission Act 2009."

    "text": "You say there are 306 ALBs that are currently active, but the dataset only shows 253 rows, why is this?\n\nWhile there are 253 rows in the data, certain bodies are represented in the dataset as a single row, to avoid double counting of their resources. There is a column on each summary table called ‘Number Of ALBs’ and a column in the machine-readable dataset called ‘overall_body_numbers’ which provides details on these ALBs. If you add these values together, they will total to the 306 ALBs that are currently active. The most prominent example of this are the Advisory Committees On Justices Of The Peace, which are 44 Advisory NDPBs represented as a single line in the data.\n\nWhy is there missing data for certain ALBs?\n\nThe data provided below was returned to the Cabinet Office at the discretion of ALBs and their sponsoring departments. While every effort was made to ensure the data was complete as possible, not all ALBs could answer each question. Questions about specific missing datapoints should be directed to the ALB or the ALB’s sponsoring department.\n\nWhy do some ALBs not report RDEL spending split into Administrative and Programme spending?\n\nWhile RDEL Admin and Programme spending is readily available for most ALBs, it could not be provided for certain ALBs. There are a number of reasons for this:\nSome ALBs have trading fund status, wherein their spending is not recorded within RDEL, CDEL and AME categories. As such, these ALBs will typically report £0 for these types of spending.\nOther ALBs operate on a cost-recovery model, wherein they carry out work on behalf of their sponsor department and charge them to recoup the costs of the work, meaning they do not have a delegated budget in the same way other ALBs do.\nSmall ALBs, such as Advisory and Tribunal NDPBs may only convene periodically, and therefore do not typically have a delegated budget from their sponsor department. Instead, any spending by these ALBs is often taken from their sponsor department’s budget, and often only covers items such as travel expenses for their chair or board."

Within this total, around 228,030 FTE were employed within the UK government’s ministerial departments, around 32,620 FTE within devolved governments, and a further 6,365 FTE employed within other UK Civil Service organisations.\nStaff employed within Executive Agencies and Non-Ministerial Departments are typically captured within both ACSES and the ALB Landscape publications. Organisations with these classifications collectively accounted for 242,019 FTE within the ALB Landscape. However, there are a few differences in the scope of these publications, as ACSES does not capture staff employed within the Forestry Commission (Non-Ministerial Department) and their Executive Agency, Forest Research. These organisations are ALBs sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and have classifications which mean their staff are civil servants, collectively employing 1,355 FTE. However, Forestry Commission are legislatively distinct from the UK domestic Civil Service, and therefore these ALBs do not appear within the ACSES publication.\nThe main distinction between the workforces captured by ACSES and the ALB Landscape Analysis is the NDPB workforce, who typically employ public servants, and are out of scope for ACSES. Across 194 NDPBs there were 155,236 FTE staff employed in 2023/24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons with ACSES\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect comparisons with the Annual Civil Service Employment Survey (ACSES) should be interpreted with caution, as the ACSES publication reports all staff for each organisation rounded to the nearest 5.

Both of these bodies are relatively new and had relatively small workforces in 2022/23, and as such would be expected to grow in size as they become fully operational.\n\n\nRelative differences (%)Overall DifferencesData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly includes data for ALBs with a workforce greater than 10 FTE.Excludes newly established/classified ALBs for this financial year.Cabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly includes data for ALBs with a workforce greater than 10 FTE.Excludes newly established/classified ALBs for this financial year.Cabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download Data\nCabinet Office | ALB Landscape Analysis 2023-24"

    "text": "What ALBs deliver\nALBs are an essential component of the central UK government, providing a wide array of essential functions on behalf of the British public.\n\nALBs such as HMRC and Network Rail deliver large-scale public services directly to the general public.\nInnovation focussed ALBs, such as Advanced Research and Invention Agency, HS2 and UK Infrastructure Bank, help the government to invest in long-term infrastructure projects.\nAs advisory bodies, ALBs such as Advisory Committee on Business Appointments and Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food provide expert advice to government departments.\nWhilst some ALBs may also act as sectoral regulators, such as Food Standards Agency and Ofgem, and play an important role in promoting the safety and protection of consumers.\n\nThe operational independence of ALBs is a critical feature of their design, ensuring that their work is not compromised by the influence of specific sectoral industries, nor disrupted by shifting political priorities.\nAs ALBs operate at a distance from direct ministerial control, they can often make impartial decisions and provide unbiased guidance. They may also have more control over their own recruitment, allowing them to employ and maintain a workforce of subject matter experts. Collectively, this independence promotes the integrity of ALBs when delivering public services, fostering trust with the wider public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current ongoing review of ALBs\n\n\n\n\n\nAll ALBs are currently undergoing a review at the time of publication (May 2025). The review will consider four key principles:\n\nMinisterial policy oversight - if a policy is of national importance then Ministers should have appropriate oversight and control of its development. Major decisions that affect the country and the public should be taken by those elected by the country to do so.\nDuplication and Efficiency - government should drive out duplication and inefficiency wherever possible, this includes if there is duplication of policy or delivery work between ALBs and Ministerial departments.\nStakeholder Management - the fact that government needs to engage stakeholders should not be a reason for an ALB to exist, government itself should be working hard to engage with a variety of partners at every stage.\nIndependent Advice - where there is a clear justification for independent advice, then this should be conducted at arms length.\n\nFor more details see this press release:"
